Traffic Signs Recognition with Tensorflow and a convolutional network

Introduction:
1.This is my attempt to tackle traffic signs classification problem with a convolutional neural network implemented in TensorFlow.

2.The highlights of this solution would be data preprocessing, data augmentation, and skipping connections in the network.

3.The accuracy on the German Traffic Sign Dataset is reaching 98.82% accuracy at present, and this can still be improved
